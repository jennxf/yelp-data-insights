# yelp_challenge

## Approach:
1. Find out what are the key topics/features that people talk about that is not present as a feature
        -   e.g: example what is recommended
        -   what sort of occassion it will be good for
        -   pet friendly?
        -   wait times?
        -   best time to visit for less crowd? traffic by day (like google)
        -   rating system: currently ratings is on an overall scale but could reflect badly on restaurant if someone gives bad review for something minor. Ratings should be multi-dimensional, so perhaps a restaurant could be rated poorly on service but highly on food and location and ambience?

        -   ratings over time. improve or drop? perhaps they took into account what complaints have been lodged and made changes.
        -   search bar is overall and doesnt return good result for nested search like (coffee shop with good ambience and wifi). Allow for more search filters on key dimensions like
            -   ambience
            -   crowd
            -   traffic by time of day
            -   pet friendly
            -   ratings
            -   new
            -   price
            -   ect.
