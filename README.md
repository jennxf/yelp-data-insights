## Kaggle challenge
I am just doing exploratory data analysis and building a topic model in the Yelp reviews
## Objective:
 -   What areas of Yelp can be improved?
----------------------------------------------------------
## Recommendations:
 -   To have a Rating over time feature instead of static rating score
 -   Break up rating into the key areas(service, food, ambience, etc.)
 -   Look at distribution of ratings of restaurants, can we dd weight to the ratings such that low ratings from non credible users does not get same weightage as other ratings.
 -   Deep dive into people's complains (rating 1 stars) vs what people are happy about (rating 5 stars)
 -  what do people most like or dislike about a place. quick summary.
